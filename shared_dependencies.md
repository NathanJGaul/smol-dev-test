1. "index.html": This is the main HTML file that will contain the structure of the website. It will include references to the other CSS files ("styles.css" and "tailwind.css"). It will contain the id names of the DOM elements that might be used by potential JavaScript functions.

2. "styles.css": This is the main CSS file that will contain custom styles for the website. It will use class and id selectors that match those in the "index.html" file.

3. "tailwind.css": This is the Tailwind CSS file that will contain utility classes used for styling the website. It will be linked in the "index.html" file and its classes will be used within the HTML structure.

Shared Dependencies:

1. HTML Element IDs: These are unique identifiers for elements in the "index.html" file. They are used to link the HTML with the CSS for styling.

2. CSS Class Names: These are identifiers in both "styles.css" and "tailwind.css" that are used to style HTML elements. They are shared with the "index.html" file where they are used in class attributes.

3. CSS Selectors: These are used in "styles.css" and "tailwind.css" to select and style HTML elements. They are shared with the "index.html" file.

4. Link to CSS files: The "index.html" file will have links to both the "styles.css" and "tailwind.css" files, making them dependencies of the HTML file.

5. Tailwind Utility Classes: These are specific classes provided by Tailwind CSS for styling. They will be used in the "index.html" file and are defined in the "tailwind.css" file.
